public class CodilityTask {
    //Numbers -- print consecutive numbers
    //Write a function that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replacÃ©e by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
    //For example, here is the output for N = 24:
    //1
    //Codility
    //Test
    //Codility
    //Coders
    //CodilityTest
    //7
    //Codility
    //Test
    //Codi1ityCoders
    //11
    //CodilityTest
    //13
    //Codility
    //TestCoders
    //Codility
    //17
