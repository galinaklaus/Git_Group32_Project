//    1Numbers -- print consecutive numbers
//Write a function that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N,
// each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility,
// Test or Coders respectively.
//  If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers:
//   2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility,
//    Test and Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be
//     replac√©e by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced
//     by CodilityTestCoders.
//For example, here is the output for N = 24:
//1
//Codility
//Test
//Codility
//Coders
//CodilityTest
//7
//Codility
//Test
//Codi1ityCoders
//11
//CodilityTest
//13
